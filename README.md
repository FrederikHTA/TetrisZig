A simple attempt at implementing a very basic version of Tetris in Zig using Raylib.

The purpose of this repository, was to test out different AI Agents, such as Github Copilots agents mode.

The project has been mostly coded using agents, and i've only made minor refactors / syntax fixes.

The project is using Zig 0.14.0.
Should be runnable by simply pulling the repository and running `zig build run` in the terminal.

The project is still in a very early stage, and is not yet complete.
